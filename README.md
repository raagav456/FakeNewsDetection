In this project, we have used various natural language processing techniques and machine learning algorithms to classify fake news articles using sci-kit libraries from python.

## Use Cases

<li>Social Media
<li>Education
<li>Election Period

## Features

The key features of the fake news detection system include :

<li>A pre-trained machine learning model that can detect fake news with high accuracy.
<li>Support for input and output files in CSV format.

## Data and File Structure

The system uses a dataset of news articles, both real and fake, to train the machine learning model. The dataset is stored in the news.csv.

The machine learning model used here is SVC from Support Vector Machine (SVM).

## Contributing

Contributions to the fake news detection system are welcome! If you find a bug or have a feature request, please open an issue on the project's GitHub repository.
